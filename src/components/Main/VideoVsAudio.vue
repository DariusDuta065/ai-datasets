                Twine specializes in providing audio and video datasets via our
                global community of creative freelancers for
                <strong>machine learning</strong> and
                <strong>AI research projects</strong>.

                But you might be wondering - Should I be building a video or
                audio dataset? And what types of projects best suit each type of
                data?
              </p>
              <p>
                The types of video data that AI researchers gather vary from
                <strong>video datasets for tracking</strong>,
                <strong>video datasets for object detection</strong> or even
                <strong>
                  video datasets of humans performing a variety of actions.
                </strong>

                Datasets in specific environments can also be arranged,
                including
                <strong>indoor video datasets</strong> or
                <strong>outdoor video datasets</strong> and we can even arrange
                for specific clothing or costumes to be provided. As well as
                object recognition and
                <strong>facial recognition datasets</strong>, Twine can also
                provide <strong>drone video datasets</strong> on request.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of audio datasets,
                <strong>speech recognition</strong> and
                <strong>audio scene analysis</strong> are the most common
                requests we receive. However, recordings can also be collected
                to form
                <strong>datasets of online conversations for training AI</strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Audio datasets can also be arranged in specific languages; e.g.
                <strong>an audio dataset of American English</strong> or
                Portuguese Brazilian.
